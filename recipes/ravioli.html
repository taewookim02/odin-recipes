  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Don't let the idea of homemade ravioli scare you. It's way easier than it<br> sounds when using wonton wrappers,
    and it's so worth the end result! These beef<br> ravioli can be boiled or baked as desired. Make a double batch
    and
    freeze some for later.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
    <li>¼ medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
    <li>30 wonton wrappers</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine ground beef, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until beef is
      browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Drain off excess fat.</li>
    <li>Transfer beef mixture to a large bowl; mix in ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and egg until thoroughly
      combined.</li>
    <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with flour. Place 15 wonton wrappers onto a lightly
      floured surface.</li>
    <li>Spoon about 1 tablespoon filling into the center of a wrapper. Dip your index finger into beaten egg yolk and
      smear a light coating of yolk all around the edge of the wrapper. Place an unfilled wrapper on top of the filling
      and lightly press the two wrappers together. Pick up the ravioli gently in your hand and pinch the edges together
      tightly, squeezing out any air. Seal and crimp the edges with a fork, then place onto the prepared parchment
      paper. Repeat to make remaining ravioli.</li>
  </ol>
